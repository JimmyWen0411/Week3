      "capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93; central characteristics of capitalism include capital accumulation, competitive markets, price system, private property, property rights recognition, voluntary exchange, and wage labor.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93; in a market economy, decision-making and investments are determined by owners of wealth, property, or ability to maneuver capital or production ability in capital and financial markets—whereas prices and the distribution of goods and services are mainly determined by competition in goods and services markets.&#91;7&#93;economists, historians, political economists and sociologists have adopted different perspectives in their analyses of capitalism and have recognized various forms of it in practice",
      "these include laissez-faire or free-market capitalism, anarcho-capitalism, state capitalism and welfare capitalism",
      "different forms of capitalism feature varying degrees of free markets, public ownership,&#91;8&#93; obstacles to free competition and state-sanctioned social policies",
      "the degree of competition in markets and the role of intervention and regulation as well as the scope of state ownership vary across different models of capitalism.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; the extent to which different markets are free and the rules defining private property are matters of politics and policy",
      "most of the existing capitalist economies are mixed economies that combine elements of free markets with state intervention and in some cases economic planning.&#91;11&#93;market economies have existed under many forms of government and in many different times, places and cultures",
      "modern capitalist societies developed in western europe in a process that led to the industrial revolution",
      "capitalist systems with varying degrees of direct government intervention have since become dominant in the western world and continue to spread",
      "economic growth is a characteristic tendency of capitalist economies.&#91;12&#93;the initial use of the term \"capitalism\" in its modern sense is attributed to louis blanc in 1850 (\"what i call 'capitalism' that is to say the appropriation of capital by some to the exclusion of others\") and pierre-joseph proudhon in 1861 (\"economic and social regime in which capital, the source of income, does not generally belong to those who make it work through their labor\").&#91;20&#93;&#58;&#8202;237&#8202;karl marx frequently referred to the \"capital\" and to the \"capitalist mode of production\" in das kapital (1867).&#91;26&#93;&#91;27&#93; marx did not use the form capitalism but instead used capital, capitalist and capitalist mode of production, which appear frequently.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93; due to the word being coined by socialist critics of capitalism, economist and historian robert hessen stated that the term \"capitalism\" itself is a term of disparagement and a misnomer for economic individualism.&#91;29&#93;bernard harcourt agrees with the statement that the term is a misnomer, adding that it misleadingly suggests that there is such as a thing as \"capital\" that inherently functions in certain ways and is governed by stable economic laws of its own.&#91;30&#93;capitalism in its modern form can be traced to the emergence of agrarian capitalism and mercantilism in the early renaissance, in city-states like florence.&#91;32&#93;capital has existed incipiently on a small scale for centuries&#91;33&#93; in the form of merchant, renting and lending activities and occasionally as small-scale industry with some wage labor",
      "simple commodity exchange and consequently simple commodity production, which is the initial basis for the growth of capital from trade, have a very long history",
      "during the islamic golden age, arabs promulgated capitalist economic policies such as free trade and banking",
      "their use of indo-arabic numerals facilitated bookkeeping",
      "these innovations migrated to europe through trade partners in cities such as venice and pisa",
      "the italian mathematicianfibonacci traveled the mediterranean talking to arab traders and returned to popularize the use of indo-arabic numerals in europe.&#91;34&#93;the economic foundations of the feudal agricultural system began to shift substantially in 16th-century england as the manorial system had broken down and land began to become concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates",
      "instead of a serf-based system of labor, workers were increasingly employed as part of a broader and expanding money-based economy",
      "the system put pressure on both landlords and tenants to increase the productivity of agriculture to make profit; the weakened coercive power of the aristocracy to extract peasant surpluses encouraged them to try better methods, and the tenants also had incentive to improve their methods in order to flourish in a competitive labor market",
      "terms of rent for land were becoming subject to economic market forces rather than to the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation.&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93;the economic doctrine prevailing from the 16th to the 18th centuries is commonly called mercantilism.&#91;37&#93;&#91;38&#93; this period, the age of discovery, was associated with the geographic exploration of foreign lands by merchant traders, especially from england and the low countries",
      "mercantilism was a system of trade for profit, although commodities were still largely produced by non-capitalist methods.&#91;39&#93; most scholars consider the era of merchant capitalism and mercantilism as the origin of modern capitalism,&#91;40&#93;&#91;41&#93; although karl polanyi argued that the hallmark of capitalism is the establishment of generalized markets for what he called the \"fictitious commodities\", i.e",
      "land, labor and money",
      "accordingly, he argued that \"not until 1834 was a competitive labor market established in england, hence industrial capitalism as a social system cannot be said to have existed before that date\".&#91;42&#93;in the mid-18th century a group of economic theorists, led by david hume (1711–1776)&#91;50&#93; and adam smith (1723–1790), challenged fundamental mercantilist doctrines—such as the belief that the world's wealth remained constant and that a state could only increase its wealth at the expense of another state.\nbroader processes of globalization carried capitalism across the world",
      "by the beginning of the nineteenth century, a series of loosely connected market systems had come together as a relatively integrated global system, in turn intensifying processes of economic and other globalization.&#91;54&#93;&#91;55&#93; late in the 20th century, capitalism overcame a challenge by centrally-planned economies and is now the encompassing system worldwide,&#91;16&#93;&#91;need quotation to verify&#93;&#91;56&#93; with the mixed economy as its dominant form in the industrialized western world.\nthe inhabitant of london could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea, the various products of the whole earth, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep",
      "militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries were little more than the amusements of his daily newspaper",
      "what an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man was that age which came to an end in august 1914.&#91;non sequitur&#93;&#91;60&#93;the postwar boom ended in the late 1960s and early 1970s and the economic situation grew worse with the rise of stagflation.&#91;65&#93;monetarism, a modification of keynesianism that is more compatible with laissez-faire analyses, gained increasing prominence in the capitalist world, especially under the years in office of ronald reagan in the united states (1981–1989) and of margaret thatcher in the united kingdom (1979–1990)",
      "public and political interest began shifting away from the so-called collectivist concerns of keynes's managed capitalism to a focus on individual choice, called \"remarketized capitalism\".&#91;66&#93;the relationship between democracy and capitalism is a contentious area in theory and in popular political movements",
      "the extension of adult-male suffrage in 19th-century britain occurred along with the development of industrial capitalism and representative democracy became widespread at the same time as capitalism, leading capitalists to posit a causal or mutual relationship between them",
      "however, according to some authors in the 20th-century, capitalism also accompanied a variety of political formations quite distinct from liberal democracies, including fascist regimes, absolute monarchies and single-party states.&#91;38&#93;democratic peace theory asserts that democracies seldom fight other democracies, but critics&#91;who?&#93; of that theory suggest that this may be because of political similarity or stability rather than because they are \"democratic\" or \"capitalist\"",
      "moderate critics argue that though economic growth under capitalism has led to democracy in the past, it may not do so in the future as authoritarian régimes have been able to manage economic growth using some of capitalism's competitive principles&#91;70&#93;&#91;71&#93; without making concessions to greater political freedom.&#91;72&#93;&#91;73&#93;political scientists torben iversen and david soskice see democracy and capitalism as mutually supportive.&#91;74&#93;robert dahl argued in on democracy that capitalism was beneficial for democracy because economic growth and a large middle class were good for democracy.&#91;75&#93; he also argued that a market economy provided a substitute for government control of the economy, which reduces the risks of tyranny and authoritarianism.&#91;75&#93;in his book the road to serfdom (1944), friedrich hayek (1899–1992) asserted that the free-market understanding of economic freedom as present in capitalism is a requisite of political freedom.&#91;need quotation to verify&#93; he argued that the market mechanism is the only way of deciding what to produce and how to distribute the items without using coercion",
      "milton friedman and ronald reagan also promoted this view",
      "friedman claimed that centralized economic operations are always accompanied by political repression",
      "in his view, transactions in a market economy are voluntary and that the wide diversity that voluntary activity permits is a fundamental threat to repressive political leaders and greatly diminishes their power to coerce",
      "some of friedman's views were shared by john maynard keynes, who believed that capitalism was vital for freedom to survive and thrive.&#91;76&#93;&#91;77&#93;freedom house, an american think-tank that conducts international research on, and advocates for, democracy, political freedom and human rights, has argued that \"there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom as measured by freedom house and economic freedom as measured by the wall street journal/heritage foundation survey\".&#91;78&#93;in capital in the twenty-first century (2013), thomas piketty of the paris school of economics asserted that inequality is the inevitable consequence of economic growth in a capitalist economy and the resulting concentration of wealth can destabilize democratic societies and undermine the ideals of social justice upon which they are built.&#91;79&#93;states with capitalistic economic systems have thrived under political regimes deemed to be authoritarian or oppressive",
      "singapore has a successful open market economy as a result of its competitive, business-friendly climate and robust rule of law",
      "nonetheless, it often comes under fire for its style of government which, though democratic and consistently one of the least corrupt,&#91;80&#93; operates largely under a one-party rule",
      "furthermore, it does not vigorously defend freedom of expression as evidenced by its government-regulated press, and its penchant for upholding laws protecting ethnic and religious harmony, judicial dignity and personal reputation",
      "the private (capitalist) sector in the people's republic of china has grown exponentially and thrived since its inception, despite having an authoritarian government",
      "augusto pinochet's rule in chile led to economic growth and high levels of inequality&#91;81&#93; by using authoritarian means to create a safe environment for investment and capitalism",
      "similarly, suharto's authoritarian reign and extirpation of the communist party of indonesia allowed for the expansion of capitalism in indonesia.&#91;82&#93;&#91;83&#93;in general, capitalism as an economic system and mode of production can be summarized by the following:&#91;86&#93;in free market and laissez-faire forms of capitalism, markets are used most extensively with minimal or no regulation over the pricing mechanism",
      "in mixed economies, which are almost universal today,&#91;94&#93; markets continue to play a dominant role, but they are regulated to some extent by the state in order to correct market failures, promote social welfare, conserve natural resources, fund defense and public safety or other rationale",
      "in state capitalist systems, markets are relied upon the least, with the state relying heavily on state-owned enterprises or indirect economic planning to accumulate capital.\nwage labor, usually referred to as paid work, paid employment, or paid labor, refers to the socioeconomic relationship between a worker and an employer in which the worker sells their labor power under a formal or informal employment contract.&#91;96&#93; these transactions usually occur in a labor market where wages or salaries are market-determined.&#91;97&#93;in capitalist economics, market competition is the rivalry among sellers trying to achieve such goals as increasing profits, market share and sales volume by varying the elements of the marketing mix: price, product, distribution and promotion",
      "merriam-webster defines competition in business as \"the effort of two or more parties acting independently to secure the business of a third party by offering the most favourable terms\".&#91;104&#93; it was described by adam smith in the wealth of nations (1776) and later economists as allocating productive resources to their most highly valued uses&#91;105&#93; and encouraging efficiency",
      "smith and other classical economists before antoine augustine cournot were referring to price and non-price rivalry among producers to sell their goods on best terms by bidding of buyers, not necessarily to a large number of sellers nor to a market in final equilibrium.&#91;106&#93; competition is widespread throughout the market process",
      "it is a condition where \"buyers tend to compete with other buyers, and sellers tend to compete with other sellers\".&#91;107&#93; in offering goods for exchange, buyers competitively bid to purchase specific quantities of specific goods which are available, or might be available if sellers were to choose to offer such goods",
      "similarly, sellers bid against other sellers in offering goods on the market, competing for the attention and exchange resources of buyers",
      "competition results from scarcity, as it is not possible to satisfy all conceivable human wants, and occurs as people try to meet the criteria being used to determine allocation.&#91;107&#93;&#58;&#8202;105&#8202;in the works of adam smith, the idea of capitalism is made possible through competition which creates growth",
      "although capitalism has not entered mainstream economics at the time of smith, it is vital to the construction of his ideal society",
      "one of the foundational blocks of capitalism is competition",
      "smith believed that a prosperous society is one where \"everyone should be free to enter and leave the market and change trades as often as he pleases.\"&#91;108&#93; he believed that the freedom to act in one's self-interest is essential for the success of a capitalist society",
      "the fear arises&#91;weasel&#160;words&#93; that if all participants focus on their own goals, society's well-being will be water under the bridge",
      "smith maintains that despite the concerns of intellectuals, \"global trends will hardly be altered if they refrain from pursuing their personal ends.\"&#91;109&#93; he insisted that the actions of a few participants cannot alter the course of society",
      "instead, smith maintained that they should focus on personal progress instead and that this will result in overall growth to the whole.\ncompetition between participants, \"who are all endeavoring to justle one another out of employment, obliges every man to endeavor to execute his work\" through competition towards growth.&#91;108&#93;economic growth is a characteristic tendency of capitalist economies.&#91;12&#93;capitalism in the form of money-making activity has existed in the shape of merchants and money-lenders who acted as intermediaries between consumers and producers engaging in simple commodity production (hence the reference to \"merchant capitalism\") since the beginnings of civilisation",
      "what is specific about the \"capitalist mode of production\" is that most of the inputs and outputs of production are supplied through the market (i.e",
      "they are commodities) and essentially all production is in this mode.&#91;9&#93; by contrast, in flourishing feudalism most or all of the factors of production, including labor, are owned by the feudal ruling class outright and the products may also be consumed without a market of any kind, it is production for use within the feudal social unit and for limited trade.&#91;87&#93; this has the important consequence that, under capitalism, the whole organisation of the production process is reshaped and re-organised to conform with economic rationality as bounded by capitalism, which is expressed in price relationships between inputs and outputs (wages, non-labor factor costs, sales and profits) rather than the larger rational context faced by society overall—that is, the whole process is organised and re-shaped in order to conform to \"commercial logic\"",
      "essentially, capital accumulation comes to define economic rationality in capitalist production.&#91;88&#93;in capitalist economic structures, supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a market",
      "it postulates that in a perfectly competitive market, the unit price for a particular good will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded by consumers (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied by producers (at the current price), resulting in an economic equilibrium for price and quantity.\nin the context of supply and demand, economic equilibrium refers to a state where economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced and in the absence of external influences the (equilibrium) values of economic variables will not change",
      "for example, in the standard text-book model of perfect competition equilibrium occurs at the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal.&#91;117&#93; market equilibrium, in this case, refers to a condition where a market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by buyers is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by sellers",
      "this price is often called the competitive price or market clearing price, and will tend not to change unless demand or supply changes",
      "the quantity is called \"competitive quantity\" or market clearing quantity.&#91;citation needed&#93;in his 1870 essay \"on the graphical representation of supply and demand\", fleeming jenkin in the course of \"introduc[ing] the diagrammatic method into the english economic literature\" published the first drawing of supply and demand curves therein,&#91;122&#93; including comparative statics from a shift of supply or demand and application to the labor market.&#91;123&#93; the model was further developed and popularized by alfred marshall in the 1890 textbook principles of economics.&#91;121&#93;there are many variants of capitalism in existence that differ according to country and region.&#91;124&#93; they vary in their institutional makeup and by their economic policies",
      "the common features among all the different forms of capitalism is that they are predominantly based on the private ownership of the means of production and the production of goods and services for profit; the market-based allocation of resources; and the accumulation of capital.\na capitalist free-market economy is an economic system where prices for goods and services are set entirely by the forces of supply and demand and are expected, by its adherents, to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy",
      "it typically entails support for highly competitive markets and private ownership of the means of production",
      "laissez-faire capitalism is a more extensive form of this free-market economy, but one in which the role of the state is limited to protecting property rights",
      "in anarcho-capitalist theory, property rights are protected by private firms and market-generated law",
      "according to anarcho-capitalists, this entails property rights without statutory law through market-generated tort, contract and property law, and self-sustaining private industry.\nthis model is prominent in western and northern european countries as well as japan, albeit in slightly different configurations",
      "the vast majority of enterprises are privately owned in this economic model.\nstate capitalism is a capitalist market economy dominated by state-owned enterprises, where the state enterprises are organized as commercial, profit-seeking businesses",
      "the designation has been used broadly throughout the 20th century to designate a number of different economic forms, ranging from state-ownership in market economies to the command economies of the former eastern bloc",
      "according to aldo musacchio, a professor at harvard business school, state capitalism is a system in which governments, whether democratic or autocratic, exercise a widespread influence on the economy either through direct ownership or various subsidies",
      "musacchio notes a number of differences between today's state capitalism and its predecessors",
      "in his opinion, gone are the days when governments appointed bureaucrats to run companies: the world's largest state-owned enterprises are now traded on the public markets and kept in good health by large institutional investors",
      "contemporary state capitalism is associated with the east asian model of capitalism, dirigisme and the economy of norway.&#91;137&#93; alternatively, merriam-webster defines state capitalism as \"an economic system in which private capitalism is modified by a varying degree of government ownership and control\".&#91;138&#93;a mixed economy is a largely market-based capitalist economy consisting of both private and public ownership of the means of production and economic interventionism through macroeconomic policies intended to correct market failures, reduce unemployment and keep inflation low",
      "the degree of intervention in markets varies among different countries",
      "some mixed economies such as france under dirigisme also featured a degree of indirect economic planning over a largely capitalist-based economy.\nsustainable capitalism is a conceptual form of capitalism based upon sustainable practices that seek to preserve humanity and the planet, while reducing externalities and bearing a resemblance of capitalist economic policy",
      "a capitalistic economy must expand to survive and find new markets to support this expansion.&#91;151&#93; capitalist systems are often destructive to the environment as well as certain individuals without access to proper representation",
      "however, sustainability provides quite the opposite; it implies not only a continuation, but a replenishing of resources.&#91;152&#93; sustainability is often thought of to be related to environmentalism, and sustainable capitalism applies sustainable principles to economic governance and social aspects of capitalism as well.\nthe importance of sustainable capitalism has been more recently recognized, but the concept is not new",
      "changes to the current economic model would have heavy social environmental and economic implications and require the efforts of individuals, as well as compliance of local, state and federal governments",
      "controversy surrounds the concept as it requires an increase in sustainable practices and a marked decrease in current consumptive behaviors.&#91;153&#93;this is a concept of capitalism described in al gore and david blood’s manifesto for the generation investment management to describe a long-term political, economic and social structure which would mitigate current threats to the planet and society.&#91;154&#93; according to their manifesto, sustainable capitalism would integrate the environmental, social and governance (esg) aspects into risk assessment in attempt to limit externalities.&#91;155&#93; most of the ideas they list are related to economic changes, and social aspects, but strikingly few are explicitly related to any environmental policy change.&#91;154&#93;the accumulation of capital is the process of \"making money\", or growing an initial sum of money through investment in production",
      "capitalism is based on the accumulation of capital, whereby financial capital is invested in order to make a profit and then reinvested into further production in a continuous process of accumulation",
      "in marxian economic theory, this dynamic is called the law of value",
      "capital accumulation forms the basis of capitalism, where economic activity is structured around the accumulation of capital, defined as investment in order to realize a financial profit.&#91;156&#93; in this context, \"capital\" is defined as money or a financial asset invested for the purpose of making more money (whether in the form of profit, rent, interest, royalties, capital gain or some other kind of return).&#91;157&#93;in mainstream economics, accounting and marxian economics, capital accumulation is often equated with investment of profit income or savings, especially in real capital goods",
      "the concentration and centralisation of capital are two of the results of such accumulation",
      "in modern macroeconomics and econometrics, the phrase \"capital formation\" is often used in preference to \"accumulation\", though the united nations conference on trade and development (unctad) refers nowadays to \"accumulation\"",
      "the term \"accumulation\" is occasionally used in national accounts.\nwage labor refers to the sale of labor under a formal or informal employment contract to an employer.&#91;96&#93; these transactions usually occur in a labor market where wages are market determined.&#91;158&#93; individuals who possess and supply financial capital to productive ventures often become owners, either jointly (as shareholders) or individually.&#91;citation needed&#93; in marxist economics, these owners of the means of production and suppliers of capital are generally called capitalists",
      "the description of the role of the capitalist has shifted, first referring to a useless intermediary between producers, then to an employer of producers, and finally to the owners of the means of production.&#91;85&#93;labor includes all physical and mental human resources, including entrepreneurial capacity and management skills, which are required to produce products and services",
      "production is the act of making goods or services by applying labor power.&#91;159&#93;&#91;160&#93;prominent critiques of capitalism allege that it is inherently exploitative,&#91;164&#93;&#91;165&#93;&#91;166&#93;alienating,&#91;167&#93;&#91;168&#93;unstable,&#91;169&#93;&#91;170&#93;unsustainable,&#91;171&#93; and economically inefficient&#91;172&#93;&#91;173&#93;&#91;174&#93;—and that it creates massive economic inequality,&#91;175&#93;&#91;176&#93;commodifies people,&#91;177&#93;&#91;178&#93;degrades the environment,&#91;171&#93;&#91;179&#93; is anti-democratic,&#91;180&#93;&#91;181&#93; and leads to an erosion of human rights&#91;182&#93; because of its incentivization of imperialist expansion and war.&#91;183&#93;&#91;184&#93;&#91;185&#93;"
